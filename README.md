# Bisection Algorithm using python

### The following algorithm determines the roots of a polynomial
### function of any degree, such as : 
### `` an*X^n + a(n-1)*X^(n-1) + ... + a2*X^2 + a1*X + a0`` where {\displaystyle a_{0},\ldots ,a_{n}}a_{0},\ldots ,a_{n} are constants and {\displaystyle x}x is the indeterminate
